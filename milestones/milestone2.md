### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

While designing the database for our hobby-based matching app, I realized there were several challenges I haved encounter. One major challenge was managing complex relationships between different tables, since many features (like hobbies, events, and group memberships) require many-to-many relationships. It might be difficult to keep the data consistent and make sure everything updates correctly when a user changes or deletes their accounts.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
