## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this stage, the planning for what the pages are to look like went well. We were able to come up with streamlined deigns that are functional and provide users with everything they need in order to create their profiles and browser through others' profiles. In addition to that, we now have a good idea on how to design our backend.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

While designing the database for our hobby-based matching app, I realized there were several challenges I haved encounter. One major challenge was managing complex relationships between different tables, since many features (like hobbies, events, and group memberships) require many-to-many relationships. It might be difficult to keep the data consistent and make sure everything updates correctly when a user changes or deletes their accounts.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We want to make sure that we're able to accomplish what we set out to do within a reasonable time frame, so we want to make sure that we're going to be overdoing it by making certain features too complex to finish within our project timeframe. Making sure our user profile database is set up properly would be helpful in ensuring that everything makes sense.
