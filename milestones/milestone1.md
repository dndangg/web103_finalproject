## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our planning for the project resulted in clear ideas for our app and its features. All features are well thought out and fit perfectly well with our main idea. The plan so far is well-structured, and we accomplished what we needed to during meetings. Each person had their assigned duties and was able to complete them.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had to make sure we mitigated scope creep, so some ideas that were brought up had to be thought out more carefully. We wanted to make sure that the features we had planned out would be realistic to implement given our timeframe. All in all, we settled on something that will still be detailed and useful, but just not jam-packed with unnecessary features.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Guidance on how to work on our location-based matching feature would be nice, such as what APIs to use. Other than that, implementing authentication features with an account system. It would also be useful to get some advice on designing the 'look' of the site itself.
