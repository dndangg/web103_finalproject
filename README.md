## About

### Description and Purpose

Therefore, this application is designed to connect people who share the same hobbies and live nearby to foster meaningful friendships and community connections. The app functions similarly to a dating platform but focuses on hobby-based matching. Users can create profiles highlighting their interests, such as dancing, hiking, painting, or gaming, and the app will match them with others in close proximity who enjoy the same activities. The goal is to encourage people to meet, share experiences, and spend quality time doing what they loveâ€”turning neighborhoods into vibrant networks of shared passion

### Inspiration

This application is inspired by Dylan's hobby of ballroom dancing. He always wants to look for a non-romantic partner who lives nearby and shares the same hobby so they can spend the time together experiencing the hobby. Therefore, this app is what he has been looking for over a long time.
