# User Stories

Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

1. Explorer - the default type of member, a person who can set their hobbies, discover nearby people and events, and can RSVP to events, and join groups.

2. Host - An explorer taking up more of a leadership role. A host is someone that publishes an event or group and can manage details, invites, and capacity.

3. Steward - A trusted community leader and moderator who can enforce guidelines for groups, review reports, and has the power to remove problematic content or users.

## Draft User Stories

1. As an Explorer, I want to sign up with email or Google, so that my matches and events sync across devices.
2. As an Explorer, I want to set hobbies and skill levels on my profile, so that I receive relevant partner suggestions.
3. As an Explorer, I want to adjust a discovery radius (with a “walking distance” toggle), so that I only see people I can realistically meet.
4. As an Explorer, I want to propose three meetup time slots to a match, so that we can confirm plans without long back-and-forth.
5. As an Explorer, I want to filter nearby events by hobby and date, so that I can join meetups that fit my schedule.
6. As a Host, I want to create an event with capacity, location, and co-hosts, so that I can manage attendance smoothly.
7. As a Host, I want to keep my exact venue hidden until someone RSVPs, so that my privacy is protected.
8. As a Host, I want to send targeted messages to RSVPs, maybes, or the waitlist, so that the right people get the right updates.
9. As a Steward, I want to review reported profiles/events and issue timeouts, so that the community stays safe and welcoming.
10. As a Steward, I want to scrub doxxing or personal info from content with one click, so that potential harm is removed immediately.
